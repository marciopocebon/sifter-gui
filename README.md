# Sifter GUI 

- Seeking Developers for this 
- Had started this while learning some java but since have become too busy with other work
  Any one wanting to create or contribute to this project is welcome.

- My thought was either a java front-end or an http panel, something like covenant or starkiller (powershell-empires GUI)
- But of course it is at the descretion of the developer to decide how they would like to code =)

Anyone interested in working on this project
Please create a branch and i will review changes
and merge within master branch in +-2hours
And obviously add developers Creds to work
